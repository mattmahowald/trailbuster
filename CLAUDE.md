## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Main Application** (`main.py`): Streamlined entry point with comprehensive logging and progress tracking
- **SalesforceAuth** (`salesforce/auth.py`): Main authentication class with detailed logging and session management
- **TrailheadCrawler** (`crawl.py`): Comprehensive crawler with progress bars and performance monitoring
- **Content Parsers** (`salesforce/parse.py`): Structured parsing functions with detailed link extraction logging
- **Gmail Integration** (`salesforce/auth_code.py`): Clean Gmail API wrapper with verification code retrieval logging
- **Logging System** (`trailbuster/logger.py`): Beautiful, structured logging with colors, emojis, and JSON output

### Key Design Patterns

- **Comprehensive Logging**: Beautiful colored console output with component-specific styling and structured JSON logging
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars with ETA calculations for all crawling operations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic timing and performance metrics for all operations
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Each component (AUTH, CRAWLER, PARSER, GMAIL) has its own logging and error handling
- **Session Persistence**: Browser sessions are saved to `trailhead_session.json` to avoid repeated logins
- **Retry Logic**: Built-in retry mechanisms for network operations and element finding
- **Poetry Integration**: Full dependency management with Poetry for consistent environments

### Authentication Flow

1. Check for existing valid session with detailed logging
2. Navigate to Trailhead login page with performance tracking
3. Enter email address with element detection logging
4. Handle reCAPTCHA if present (manual intervention with user prompts)
5. Retrieve verification code from Gmail with detailed API logging
6. Submit verification code with success/failure tracking
7. Save session for future use with file operation logging

### Important Implementation Details

- **Streamlined Interface**: `main.py` provides a clean, focused entry point with comprehensive logging
- **LLM-Optimized Content**: All extracted content is structured specifically for LLM processing with:
  - Learning objectives and instructions
  - Content categorization (text, code, lists, headings)
  - Link extraction and validation with detailed logging
  - Metadata collection (time estimates, difficulty, prerequisites)
- **Comprehensive Crawling**: `TrailheadCrawler` can process individual modules, entire trails, or batch URLs with progress tracking
- **Progress Tracking**: Beautiful progress bars with ETA calculations for all operations
- **Structured Data**: Uses dataclasses (`LessonContent`, `ModuleContent`, `ContentItem`) for type safety
- **Organized Selectors**: Element selectors are organized by purpose in dictionaries for maintainability
- **Browser runs in non-headless mode** by default for debugging
- **Session files** (`trailhead_session.json`, `token.json`) are gitignored
- **Gmail API** requires `credentials.json` file from Google Cloud Console
- **Environment variable** `SALESFORCE_EMAIL` required in `.env` file
- **reCAPTCHA handling** includes automatic detection and manual intervention prompts
- **Poetry Integration**: Full dependency management with development and production dependencies

## Development Workflow

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Setup development environment
make setup

# 2. Create environment file
make env-create
# Edit .env with your SALESFORCE_EMAIL

# 3. Run a test crawl
make example-module

# 4. Check logs
ls logs/  # View JSON log files
```

### Code Quality Workflow

```bash
# Before committing
make dev  # Runs format, lint, and test

# Or run individually
make format
make lint
make test
```

### Adding Dependencies

```bash
# Add production dependency
make poetry-add PKG=requests

# Add development dependency
make poetry-add-dev PKG=pytest-mock
```

## Security Considerations

- Never commit `credentials.json`, `.env`, `token.json`, or session files
- Gmail API uses read-only scope for security
- Session files contain authentication tokens and should be protected
- Log files may contain sensitive information and should be reviewed before sharing
- Use `make security-check` to verify no sensitive files are in git

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Colorama not found**: Run `poetry run pip install colorama` or `make install-dev`
2. **Gmail API errors**: Ensure `credentials.json` is in project root
3. **Session issues**: Use `make run-clear` to clear saved sessions
4. **Link extraction problems**: Check logs for detailed debugging information
5. **Performance issues**: Use `make profile` for performance analysis

### Debugging

- All operations are logged with detailed information
- Check `logs/` directory for JSON log files
- Use `make run-stats` to see crawling statistics
- Link extraction issues are logged with detailed statistics
- Performance metrics are automatically logged for all operations

## Performance Monitoring

- Automatic performance tracking for all operations
- Navigation timing with retry statistics
- Link extraction performance metrics
- Gmail API response times
- Overall crawl performance statistics
- Use `make profile` for detailed performance analysis
